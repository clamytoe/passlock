NOTE: This project was generated with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) along with [@clamytoe's](https://github.com/clamytoe) [toepack](https://github.com/clamytoe/toepack) project template.

### Initial setup
```zsh
(base) âžœ  ~ cd Projects
(base) âžœ  Projects git clone https://github.com/clamytoe/passlock.git
(base) âžœ  Projects cd passlock
```

#### Anaconda setup
If you are an Anaconda user, this command will get you up to speed with the base installation.
```zsh
(base) âžœ  passlock git:(master) conda env create
(base) âžœ  passlock git:(master) conda activate passlock
```

#### Regular Python setup
If you are just using normal Python, this will get you ready, but I highly recommend that you do this in a virtual environment. There are many ways to do this, the simplest using *venv*.
```zsh
(base) âžœ  passlock git:(master) python3 -m venv venv
(base) âžœ  passlock git:(master) source venv/bin/activate
(passlock) âžœ  passlock git:(master) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Final setup
```zsh
(passlock) âžœ  passlock git:(master) pip install -e .
```

## Usage
At the moment I just have a sample entry so simply running the command will demonstrate what it does. 

```zsh
(passlock) âžœ  passlock git:(master) passlock
Successfully created: /home/mohh/Documents/.passlock/ip.bin

[ip]
INFO: http://192.168.2.1
USER: admin
PASS: admin
```

The encrypted file will be created in `~/Documents/.passlock/ip.bin` and it's contents will look something like this:

```text

```

At the same time, it will generate a new private and public keys for the program and stash them in `~/.passloc/`.

> **NOTE**: At this time, you must run the `passlock` command from within the project folder. I'm working on how to update the path for the log files dynamically during the project creation. 
## TODO
* Setup path for logging during package creation
* Add a CLI interface that will:
    * List all entries
    * Search for a particular entry
    * Add/Update and entry
    * Remove and entry
    * Export all data
* Add a GUI that does the same as the CLI

## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with with `pytest -v`, please ensure that all tests are passing and that you've checked your code with the following packages before submitting a pull request:
* black
* isort
* mypy
* pytest-cov

I am not adhering to them strictly, but try to clean up what's reasonable.
